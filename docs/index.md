# FlightLab: 3D Printed RC Plane Design and Build Documentation

Welcome to **FlightLab** — a complete, structured documentation of the design, analysis, and fabrication process for a **3D printed RC aircraft**.

This documentation covers the entire workflow for developing a custom 3D printed RC plane, including:

* **Concept design and configuration**
* **Aerodynamic modeling and analysis**
* **Structural and load simulation**
* **Component integration**
* **3D printing and assembly process**

## Inspiration and References

This documentation was inspired in part by the comprehensive Drone Design design tutorials available from the **Dynamix Systems** and similar educational sources. In particular, the workflow and structural design methods outlined here drew conceptual influence from the video series available at:

[3D Printed RC Plane Design Series – YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuLbafql1lM&list=PLQpp11UVG0BpugWGMypDLL-O1jd6pH7je)

This playlist provided valuable insight into iterative design, modular assembly, and 3D printing considerations for lightweight Drone Design structures. It served as an educational foundation for refining both the design logic and documentation approach used throughout the **FlightLab** project.
