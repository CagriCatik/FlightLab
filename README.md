> 3D Printed RC Plane Design and Build Documentation

---

## Overview

**FlightLab** is a complete, structured documentation of the **design, analysis, and fabrication** process for a 3D printed RC aircraft.  
It serves as both a technical reference and an educational resource for developing **custom, modular aircraft** using **additive manufacturing techniques**.

The project integrates **aerodynamic modeling**, **structural analysis**, and **3D printing workflows** into a cohesive engineering pipeline.  
Full documentation is available through the hosted MkDocs site:

## Build

**FlightLab** is designed for **FDM 3D printing** using materials like **PLA, PETG, or LW-PLA**.  
Each component is modular, enabling easy printing, replacement, and iteration.

Sections include:

- **Design intent and load considerations**
- **CAD modeling and part breakdown**
- **Servo and actuator integration**
- **Print orientation, layer height, and infill recommendations**
- **Post-processing and assembly procedures**

---

## Tutorials

Step-by-step tutorials cover the entire process from concept to flight-ready prototype, including:

- **Aerodynamic setup** with XFLR5 and OpenVSP  
- **Structural validation** through Fusion360 simulation  
- **3D slicing and print optimization**  
- **Servo alignment and control linkage setup**

Each tutorial provides images, simulation data, and printable model references.

## Inspiration and References

This documentation was inspired in part by the **Drone Design** tutorials from **Dynamix Systems** and similar educational sources.  
The conceptual and structural design methods are influenced by iterative workflows showcased in:

**Reference:** [3D Printed RC Plane Design Series – YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQpp11UVG0BpugWGMypDLL-O1jd6pH7je)

The referenced material offered valuable insights into **lightweight design**, **modular assembly**, and **additive manufacturing optimization**. It shaped the documentation and development structure applied throughout **FlightLab**.
